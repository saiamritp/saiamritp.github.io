Hi! 
I’m currently an M.S. (Research, Computer Science) student at IIIT Hyderabad. Until recently, I was working as a Research Associate at Centre for Visual Information and Technology (CVIT), working on Face Biometrics using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

I finished my undergraduate from IIIT Bhubanbeswar(IIIT-BH) in 2019, with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have been lucky to receive mentorship by some amazing people including Dr. Anoop Namboodri, Dr. Avinash Sharma, Dr. Aurobindo Routray(IIT-Kharagpur), and Dr. Manish Gupta(Director, Google Research, India).

I am incredibly thankful to my collaborators and mentors, and enjoy exploring new domains through collaborations. If you have questions or would like to work together, feel free to reach out through
[email](mailto:patnaiksaiamrit@gmail.com)!

## __Research Interests__

I love to explore different problems, especially in computer vision, Mathematics behind them and experiment with different domains frequently. Successful or not, I try to learn something out of them. I try to share my learnings and experiences on my blog. When I’m not doing academic stuff, I may be spotted in a peaceful corner reading some book, playing my keyboard, or taking naps!

Have a look at my CV for more details!
